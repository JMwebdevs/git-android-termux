                  The journey of young orphan Xin's rise to glory as a great
                  general in the Qin Kingdom's quest to do what has never been

                  Xin is a war orphan in a poor village in the kingdom of Qin.
                  He has big dreams of becoming a great general, and when his
                  best friend's life is cut short by political machinations, Xin
                  sets off to find a deposed ruler and help restore his place on
                  the throne, while working his way up through the ranks of the
                  Qin kingdom's army to do what no one has ever done
                  before—unify China.

                <div class="p1">
                  Xin's quest begins when his friend Piao, another war orphan
                  who shares his dream of becoming a great general, is taken
                  away by a mysterious minister to the capital, and Xin is left
                  to work and train on his own. But one fateful night, Piao
                  returns bloodied and on the brink of death, with his dying
                  words being for Xin to carry on their dreams and meet a
                  certain person in a nearby village. Xin rushes to fulfill
                  Piao's final request, only to meet a boy who looks exactly
                  like Piao. But this is no ordinary boy—it's the king of Qin,
                  Ying Zheng! And assassins are hot on his tail!
