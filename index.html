        In the chaotic era of China's Warring States, a young war orphan named
        <strong >Shin</strong> held one dream to become the
        <em>Greatest General Under the Heavens</em>. Together with his sworn
        brother Hyou, Shin trained every day in the village, their wooden swords
        clashing with the hopes of rising beyond their lowly status.

        history. His journey would be filled with bloodshed, brotherhood,
        strategy, and sacrifice.
